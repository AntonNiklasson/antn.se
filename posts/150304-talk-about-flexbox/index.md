title: Talk About Flexbox

Yesterday I went to a meetup to talk about flexbox. It is definitely not something that I would do spontaneously.
I have felt for a year or so that I really want to work on my "public speaking skills". It is really not my strong side at the moment.
So, I guess the only way to get better is to acctually do it.

I did a short intro to flexbox and the current state of it. Here are my <a href="http://antonniklasson.github.io/talk-flexbox">slides</a>.
