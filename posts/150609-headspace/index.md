I have tried something new. For the last 10 days I have spent 10 minutes each day in complete silence. It has been amazing.

I spend most of my time thinking about things. Solving different kinds of problems. And sometimes it is hard for my mind to keep up with my brain. From time to time I really enjoy completely shutting off the brain. Usually that works pretty good when I'm listening to a podcast or some music, or exercising. It is not always enough though.

I recently read something about meditation and how some people describe the feeling. So I decided to try it. What I have found while meditating is that I am able to reset my thoughts somehow. After a 10 minute session I feel more alert. I feel more awake and calm. I love it.

I found the app Headspace and went for it. I must say it has been harder than I expected, but I am getting better at it. Here is a short they have made to get you started:

I tried doing the exercise in the morning, straight after school in the afternoon and later at night. So far I have gotten the most out of it in the afternoon. My mornings are usually pretty stress free anyway, and my nights aswell. I guess that is just personal preference. And I am sure it will change with time.

I will definitely try to turn this into a habit and make it a part of my life.
