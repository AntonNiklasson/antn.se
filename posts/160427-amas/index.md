title: Ask Them Anything on GitHub

I discovered this interesting thing on GitHub. There is a trend of opening a repository called _ama_ and allow for anyone to ask you questions.

A question is just an _Issue_ on the repo itself. The person hosting the repo answers the question with a comment and closes the issues.

Since it is GitHub we are talking about, most questions are tech/code/geek related, but sometimes they are broader and you get to know the person behind the username.

Here are some of them that I found interesting:

- [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama)
- [Sebastian Mckenzie](https://github.com/kittens/ama)
- [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/feedback)
- [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos/ama)

Also, Sindre maintains a [huge list of amas](https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas).
