A few months back I started learning CSS Grid. I usually want to learn by doing, and I always feel like
things like these are explained through walls of text and documentation. So I set out to build something
interactive. The key is finding the right balance between _freedom_ and _progression_. ðŸ‘Œ

So here it is: [cssgrid.pro](http://www.cssgrid.pro)

It's far from "finished", I would say it's a decent start. I would like to add a few more challenges and make everything
feel a bit more _smooth_. Anyway, feel free to try it out.
