I am focusing a lot on code during the first half of 2015. I am attending the
following courses:

-   [TNM048](http://webstaff.itn.liu.se/~jimjo/courses/TNM048/): Information
    Visualization
-   [TDDD57](https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDDD57/index.sv.shtml): Physical
    Interaction and Game Development
-   [TDDD27](https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDDD27/index.en.shtml): Advanced Web
    Programming
-   [TDDD04](https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDDD04/): Software Testing
-   A Demola project ([what?](http://eastsweden.demola.net/about))

I have really high hopes for each and everyone of these. I know for sure that
most of them are based on projects, which fits me really nicely.

## Information Visualization

All I know for now is that it starts out with D3.js and moves into data minig in
some form. It sounds super interesting, and I am really looking forward to dig
into all of that.

## Physical Interaction and Game Development

I have no idea what this is all about. I have heard some people call it "that
one about Kinnect". So I guess that is involved somehow. That alone got me
interested.

I made a game this past fall which was super fun. Maybe not the gameplay itself,
but coding it was awesome. Hopefully this will be even more fun.

## Advanced Web Programming

All I know about this course is that it is quite open with just a few
guidelines/rules. All students are supposed to build a complete web app. The
front-end must be written as a single-page app. And the back-end should also use
some widely adopted framework. It sounds fun.

I have some ideas on what to build for this one. I will probably start early and
make it a project outside school aswell.

## Software Testing

I have no idea what to expect from this one. The general topic is interesting
and useful and I really hope we get to try out things in a practical way.

## Demola

This is quite new here at LiU. Students get the chance to work in a
cross-functional team with close connections to some company and doing actual
work in a more realistic situation.

I haven\'t met my group yet, but I am sure it will work out just fine. The
company though is called Arris. Our task is to try to figure out what role the
TV might play in the coming years. Everyone has these huge display all over the
house that aren\'t being used most of the time.
