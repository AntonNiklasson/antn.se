title: Default to sharing

I think all software developers should default to sharing their work. Perhaps
you're not allowed to share publicly, but you can (probably) always share
internally. If you are learning something new and are enjoying the process,
chances are that someone else will want to get in on that.

When you share your learnings, insights and experiences it creates an
opportunity for others around you to even realize that there is something to be
learned. Don't rob them of that opportunity.

If you feel like sharing in itself is a lot of work, consider just lowering the
bar for what you define as sharing. You don't have to author a technical
deep-dive that's published on the company's engineering blog. You can just whip
up a brief slack message and post it to the relevant slack channel.

Don't overcomplicate it, just share.
