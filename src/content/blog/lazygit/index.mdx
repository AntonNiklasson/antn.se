summary: A terminal UI for git that changed how I interact with version control
---

I have been using git from the command line for years now. I know the common
commands by heart, and I can usually get by without thinking too much about it.
But there is something about the friction of typing out commands that has
always bothered me. Not in a way that made me actively look for a solution, but
I knew there was room for improvement.

A few months ago I came across [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit),
and it immediately clicked. It is a terminal UI for git commands, and it fits
perfectly into my workflow. I still get to stay in the terminal, but I am not
typing out commands all the time anymore.

## What it actually is

Lazygit is a wrapper for git that replaces the command line interface with an
interactive UI. You navigate with your keyboard, see everything in panels, and
perform actions with single key presses. No more `git add .`, `git commit -m`,
`git push origin main`. It is all just there, visible and ready.

The interface is split into different panels: files, branches, commits, stash.
You switch between them with numbers or tab, and each panel has its own set of
actions. It is completely keyboard-driven, which is important to me. I do not
have to reach for the mouse, ever.

## What I use it for

I launch Lazygit whenever I want to commit something. That is basically the
entry point for me. I used to run `git status` to see what has changed, then
stage files with `git add`, write a commit message, and push. With Lazygit I
just see everything right away.

Staging files is just pressing space on a file. Unstaging is the same key.
Committing is `c`. The whole flow is just faster, and I can see what I am doing
without having to run status checks all the time.

I also use it for more complex operations that I would usually have to look up.
Things like interactive rebasing, cherry-picking, or managing worktrees. The UI
guides me through it, so I do not have to remember the exact commands or flags.
It is all just available in the interface.

## The learning curve

I expected it to take some time to learn all the shortcuts, but it is actually
very intuitive. The commands are displayed at the bottom of the screen, so you
can always see what is available in the current context. You learn by using it.

There is a built-in help menu with `?` that shows all available commands for
the current view. I found myself using that a lot in the beginning, but after a
week or so I had internalized most of the shortcuts I need daily.

## Where it fits in

I still use git commands directly sometimes. For quick one-liners or when I am
already in the terminal doing something else, it is faster to just type
`git pull` than to launch Lazygit. But for anything that involves multiple
steps, or when I need to see the state of the repository, I reach for Lazygit.

I have been thinking about this lately, how the tools we use shape our workflow.
Lazygit made me more comfortable with git operations I used to avoid because
they felt too manual or error-prone. Rebasing, for example. I do it all the
time now, because it is just easier. The UI makes it clear what is happening,
and I can see the result immediately.

## What I like about it

The fact that it is completely keyboard-driven is huge for me. I hate context
switching between keyboard and mouse. Everything is at my fingertips, and I can
move through the interface without thinking about it.

The visual feedback is also great. I can see staged vs unstaged changes, the
commit history, branches, all at once. It gives me a better mental model of the
repository state than running commands and reading text output.

And it is fast. There is no loading time, no UI lag. It is just there when I
need it, and it gets out of the way when I am done.

## Final thoughts

I am not someone who changes tools often. I usually stick with what works, even
if there are better options out there. But Lazygit was an obvious improvement,
so I adopted it pretty quickly.

If you spend time working with git, especially if you are in the terminal a
lot, I would recommend trying it out. It is not about replacing your knowledge
of git commands, it is about making the common operations faster and more
comfortable. And that adds up over time.
