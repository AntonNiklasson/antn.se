title: Measurable Teams
date: 2018-07-14

During the last 12 months I've been a part of a rather large software
development team. There is always a discussion going on. Someone is feeling
frustrated, someone else just got a great idea and wants to share. A third
person is not comfortable with our static code analysis configuration.

Since joining the team I have spent some time trying make us the best team
possible. And there is always something to work on. Whether it be how we onboard
a new member, how we release code or how developers and UX designers work
together.

Being part of a team is not always easy -- there is a lot of communication
involved, and having great communication is a huge success factor for us. We
need to make sure everyone stays productive and is working on the right thing.
But what is even more important for the teams long-term success and is that we
communicate _how we feel_.

Sometimes the task at hand is the most exciting, challenging and rewarding thing
you have ever worked on. Sometimes it is the complete opposite. Everything
sucks. But that is life. And life spills in to work sometimes.

My friend [Henrik][1] wrote about how he has been [monitoring the teams
well-being over time][2]. How have you been feeling during the last week? How
satisfied did you feel at work this week? These are the kinds of questions he
asked us every single week for the last 8 months or so. Go read his post, that
topic is super interesting. Data-driven retrospectives is a thing now.

I found [Atlassian's Team Health Monitor][3] while planning for a retrospective
a few weeks back. They have compiled their insights and shared knowledge about
what a high-performing team is doing right into something actually tangible and
actionable. I think the Health Monitor is great for us because it gives us a
clearer picture of what is working well, and what areas to focus on going
forward. It is different from what Henrik does, but it is related. The lack of
well-defined long-term goals might be the cause of frustration and
dissatisfaction within the team.

About two weeks ago we completed our first health checkup. We spent some time
understanding the different attributes, what they mean to everyone and how we
apply them to our daily work. It sparked some great conversations right away. We
then proceeded to cast our votes and decided on a joint opinion on each of the
eight attributes. Some of the attributes are closely related to each other, and
some of them felt a bit off for our particular case. But it was a great start.

Yesterday I facilitated another retrospective focusing on one of the weak spots
from that first monitor. Being able to introduce the why with a clear motivation
and reference back to what we expressed two weeks back felt great. It makes it
more relatable and I would assume each member feels a bit more ownership in the
process. You do not have to facilitate the retrospectives in order to have a say
in what they are about. Which I think is great.

Going forward I am definitely going to try and incorporate both Henrik's
excellent weekly questionnaire and the results from continuously running the
Health Monitor every six weeks or so.

What gets measured gets managed.
