I have a long list of various inboxes that I care about. Some are more important
than others. I want to reserve my time and energy to what is actually important
in life, and cut out as much as possible of everything else. All in the spirit
of [embracing intentionality](https://antn.se/embrace-intentionality). This list
helps me be a bit more aware, which hopefully leads to more control and
intentional behaviour.

Here is an unordered list of inboxes I care about right now:

-   Email
-   Messenger
-   iMessage
-   Obsidian: daily notes, new fleeting notes
-   LinkedIn messages
-   Instagram DM
-   X: the feed itself, bookmarked and liked tweets
-   Github notifications
-   Slack
-   Notes I take in Apple Notes
-   Todoist inbox and today's schedule
-   Day One journal entries
-   Physical mail
-   Kivra (digitized mail)
-   Discord communities
-   Readwise Reader, both my library and the feed
-   Youtube: all channels I subscribe to, and all videos I capture in "Watch
    later"
-   Calendar invites
-   WhatsApp

I am not trying to cut everything out, I just want to fine-tune and minimise a
bit. Awareness is the first step.

My _ambition_ for these vary from ~realtime to ~monthly. What is interesting
here though are the ones that are high on time spent, but low on importance. I
want to dial those back a bit.
