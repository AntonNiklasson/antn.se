I have been writing code with an english keyboard layout for the last 18 months
or so. I tried it mostly for fun at first, but I quickly realized how much
easier it was.

I won't go into details as to _why_ it is easier, just trust me. Or google [an
image of an english keyboard][1]. Basically most characters require either just
a single button, or Shift combined with a button. Most of the time less fingers
are involved in typing one specific character.

So writing code is way smoother... But I still need `åäö` from time to time. I
want the english layout, but still being able to write the swedish letters as
easy as possible.

In Linux I had a pretty sweet setup for this. `Alt Gr` in combination with the
buttons I would normally use for the swedish letters would give me those
letters. I haven't found the same easy solution in macOS. Until just this week I
used to switch between the english and swedish layouts with
`Ctrl+Alt+Cmd+Enter`. This is kind of awkward most of the time, since I usually
lost track of what the current layout was. And some apps even switched for me
without me noticing.

This new thing that I found lets me completely move over to the english layout.

To get those swedish letters that I need I can simply hold down `a` and `o`
respectively then either pick a letter by pressing a number or using the arrow
keys. Type `A` and `O` to get the capital ones.

I just removed the swedish keyboard layout as an Input Source. I think I can get
used to this.
