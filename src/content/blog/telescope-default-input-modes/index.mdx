title: Default input modes in telescope pickers
date: 2025-01-04

I have been using Neovim as my main editor for about a year now. I got started
with LazyVim, which is a great distribution that really helped me get up to
speed faster. It comes with a lot of great plugins and settings out of the box,
one of which is (or was) [telescope][telescope-repo]. Since I started using
LazyVim they actually [moved to fzf-lua as the default driver for
pickers][lazyvim-changelog]. But I am still using telescope via [LazyVim's
extras][telesceop-extras] though.

For some of the pickers I use, I usually do not filter the list down by typing.
I bring up the picker, escape out of insert mode and start navigating the list
with `j` and `k`. I found a nice little optimiziation for these: I can just
default the mode to `normal` instead. This makes my life a tiny bit better.

Since I am using LazyVim, the package configuration is really easy. I can just
specify a few overwrites, and still use all the detailed configuration that
comes with the distro.

These are the picker settings I have right now:

```lua
  return {
      "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
      opts = {
          pickers = {
              buffers = {
                  initial_mode = "normal",
              },
              lsp_references = {
                  initial_mode = "normal",
              },
              lsp_definitions = {
                  initial_mode = "normal",
              },
          },
      },
  },
```
