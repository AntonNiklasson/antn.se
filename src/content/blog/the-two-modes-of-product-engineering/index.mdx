One of the most important skills for a software engineer working on a product is
to be able to switch between _launch mode_ and _stability mode_.

This idea has crystalized in my head over the last few years of working on
digital products in different environments. Engineers that are able to make
precise calls on when and how to move between these two modes will be successful
in whatever context they work in.

The idea is that product development, or rather _feature development_, moves in
cycles. But not cycles of _intensity_, as I have heard many times. But rather in
cycles of _priorities_. Early on in feature development, the goal is to better
understand your user's needs. This is launch mode. After the first _usable_
version is out in public, you start learning and understanding. Building a solid
foundation for long-term success becomes more important. This is when you switch
gears to _stability mode_. The product teams that are able to align on this
approach will be able to collectively navigate uncertainty, user feedback and
long-term maintenance.

This idea is almost philosophical, it is definitely not a one-size-fits-all. But
I do think that the core idea is universally applicable. Each individual team
should decide on what their minimum viable product should look like. What is
important here is not exactly what you build in the different phases. But rather
that the whole team communicates and aligns on what you are trying to achieve.

The different modes should affect the daily priorities and trade-offs. It should
guide internal discussions about scalability and maintainability. And it should
always be a factor in helping you decide what to work on _this week_. Or perhaps
more importantly: what _not_ to work on.

## Launch mode

Launch mode is all about moving fast and getting _something_ into the hands of
your users. The goal of this phase is to build just enough to start learning. It
is not about perfection. I try to think of it as getting a first usable artifact
out as quickly as possible, and then just figuring out a direction for further
improvements.

These are guidelines I try to adhere to while in launch mode:

-   **Prioritize ruthlessly** -- Make sure what you work on is _critical_ for
    the core flows. It is better to add things back in once you complete the
    core, then to delay the release of the core to include details that might
    not be important.
-   **Pay attention to future improvements** -- You will likely run into things
    that seem important. I call these _side-quests_. Refactors, contributing a
    new component to the design-system, or improving the test infrastructure.
    Write things down for upcoming stability work, but do not shift focus away
    from launching.
-   **Do not overplan** -- It is natural to fall into the trap of planning to
    far into the future. Stay humble and remember that what your are working on
    right now is an experiment. You build this to learn, what comes later
    depends on what you learn.

## Stability mode

Stability mode is about building a foundation for long-term success and growth.
This is where you invest for the long-term: focus on the details and make sure
everything is at the level of polish that you want. Launch mode was about moving
fast in order to start learning -- _you make it work_. Stability mode is more
about taking two steps back and building a solid foundation -- _you make it
great_.

These are values I stick to in stability mode:

-   **Up the craft** -- Focus on raising the bar, in every possible aspect you
    can think of. In launch mode, you might glance over details in favor of
    speed. This is the opposite of that, make the details count.
-   **Make it enjoyable** -- Prioritize code quality, readability and
    maintainability. Get rid of friction in the developer experience and make it
    easier for your future self to make changes.
-   **Automate quality assurance** -- Invest in automated quality assurance.
    Make it harder to accidentaly break the system.
-   **Stop guessing** -- Learn from the people actually using the feature you
    are building. Invest into observability, various types of logging, adress
    feedback from user testing.
-   **Solve it once** -- For each of the bugs and that are eventually reported,
    solve it in a way that also prevents it from happening again.

## When do you switch?

One of the key metrics that can help you decide what mode to go for is
_uncertainty_. What do you actually know about the user and how they will use
this feature? If uncertainty is high, you should probably spend more time in
launch mode. This will help you get something measurable out and start
collecting data. On the other hand if you know that this feature will be a
long-lived thing, spend time on stability and make sure the base for the future
is solid. If you never get to stability mode, and always put launching something
as the top priority, you accumulate tech debt and the system will be harder and
harder to work with. Launch mode can be costly, but it is the best we can do
when uncertainty is high.

The most important thing in my opinion is making sure everyone working on the
project are aligned. If a developer works as in stability mode while the project
lead expects rapid progress towards a first launch the team is set up for
disappointment and friction. Move as a single unit, and agree on what is
important _right now_.
