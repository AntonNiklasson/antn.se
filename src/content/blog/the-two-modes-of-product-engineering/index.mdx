title: The two modes of product engineering

One of the most important skill for a product engineer is to be able to switch
between _launch mode_ and _stability mode_.

This idea has crystalized in my head over the last few years of working on
digital products in different environments. Engineers that are able to flip
between these two will be able to output huge amounts of value no matter the
context.

This is how I would explain the two modes:

Launch mode is all about moving fast and getting an _minimum viable product_
into your user's hands. The goal of this phase is get the flywheel of learning
and measuring in motion, not perfecting all the details. Anything you run into
that would slow you down, and perhaps derail you from delivering as fast as
possible on that target should be avoided at all costs.

Stability mode is about building a foundation for growth. This is the time for
refactors, integration tests and upstream contributions to the design system.
The goal of this phase is about setting the project up for _long-term success_.

The different goals should affect the daily priorities and trade-offs. It should
guide internal discussions about scalability and maintainability. And it should
always help you decide what details are important. Or perhaps more importantly:
what is _not_ important.

I have tried to come up with principles that can help you get into the right
mindset.

In launch mode:

-   Ask yourself _what can I get away with?_. Copy-paste code, hard-code some
    number, ignore test coverage.
-   Acknowledge side-quests and take note of things that you would like get back
    to at some point. But do not lose track of the tight core flows that makes
    for the MVP, keep pushing.
-   Make small changes in a safe space. This likely means all code is released
    behind a feature flag. Keep batches small and focused.
-   Question the scope. Prioritize ruthlessly to make sure what you work on is
    _critical_ for the core flows to make sense

When in stability mode, this is flipped up-side-down:

-   Prioritize code quality and refactor the shared logic.
-   Invest in automated quality assurance
-   Continue to iterate, but stop guessing. Listen to the users using the
    feature.
-   Focus on raising the bar, in every aspect you can think of.

If everyone involved in builing the product understands this core idea, and
practice this every single day, you will be successful. You will be able to move
fast and _launch_. Course correct if you have to, as you start learning. And
once you stumble upon something that sticks, you will be able to exploit that
and polish it into something that your users will enjoy for years to come.

I have found that sharing this idea and clearly communcating what my intentions
are in a project is a very effective way of strengthening the team spirit and
finding a shared vision.
