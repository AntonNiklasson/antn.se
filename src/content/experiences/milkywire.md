I was part of a small team working hard to improve the experience for Milkywire's impacters on the platform. We developed a financial dashboard, improved the internal bookkeeping system and iterated on the content creation flow.

I implemented features and solved bugs in the entire tech stack. From UI and UX in React Native, to database design and backend integrations.

Noteworthy technologies included in this project: react native, react, fastify, postgres, node.js, TDD.
