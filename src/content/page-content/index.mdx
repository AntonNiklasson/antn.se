Professionally I am [a software engineer at Sana][a], I also have a background
in consulting and freelancing. I am very interested in [product building and
agile development][b]. I constantly push my teams to be [as productive and
joyful as possible][c]. Writing code alone is one thing, but doing it
productively, at scale, over time is actually pretty tricky it turns out.

I am interested in systems and tools around personal productivity. Life is
over-whelming, and I want to be [intentional about how I spend my time][j]. I
read [Getting Things Done][e] many years ago, and recently I have adopted ideas
from Tiago Forte around [building a second brain and PARA][f]. I have realized
with experience that my brain is not very good at keeping track of many things
at once. So I am [trying to off-load it and write things down][i]. Nothing
really beats Apple Notes, but Obsidian has a special place in my heart. I have
been on Todoist for probably ten years at this point. I _love_ trying new tools,
but I keep coming back to the stable and polished experience that Todoist
offers.

On that note; I have been using Vim on and off for a long time now. I found
[this old introduction][g] I wrote back in 2016. Since then, I have spent many
hours in VS Code. Though recently I started using [neovim as my primary
editor][h]. There is just something about having complete control over your
environment that I am drawn to.
