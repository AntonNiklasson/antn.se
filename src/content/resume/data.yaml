intro: |
    I have broad experience in software development, product engineering and helping teams deliver under pressure. I really enjoy crafting delightful interfaces, all the way from data loading to subtle micro-interactions.

    I will continuously seek to improve the team and the environment that I am a part of. Everything from deployment infrastructure and testing strategies to agile software development and a teams well-being are interesting areas for me to focus on.
