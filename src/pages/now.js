I spend some time working on different projects, some are publicly available some are not. The one I'm the most into right now is *[Shortcuts.rocks](http://www.shortcuts.rocks)*. Some others are [LearnReact.xyz](http://www.learnreact.xyz), [CSSGrid.pro](http://www.cssgrid.pro), [react-dategrid](https://www.github.com/AntonNiklasson/react-dategrid) and [react-clickcopy](https://www.github.com/AntonNiklasson/react-clickcopy).

I recently founded my own company - I am now available as a freelancer! üòç I have done a lot of React, Redux, React Native and Node.js previously.

I was previously employed at [Netlight](https://www.netlight.com/) as a consultant. I spent about a year and a half at Bonnier News building parts of their new publishing platform.
